Tesla Supercharger capacity will grow by ~1000 more soon. Most likely over time.
Should mention that the battery cells used for this are 200 Wh/kg vs 250 for Model S. No short term supply constraint.
"NHTSA confirmed to Bloomberg that they found no safety concern with the Model S and that it will be recalled if this continues. As stated before, safety is our number one priority."
Run time is super slow by Europe and Asia standards
Nicheman (power of appealing to niche audiences) strikes again hahaha

Motor Trend tests Model S as fastest American sedan at 3.9 sec 0-60 mph. Car is flying pretty hard. Stay tuned for 144 mile range.
Starting Feb with Autopilot HW2 going through vehicle hardware checkout. Main goal of this is enabling low cost autonomous transport of cars to destination &amp; accelerating the Model 3 mainstreaming.
That was 16 years ago &amp; will likely never be 16 ings true. Thanks for believing.
The cyberpunk of Sigmarant is almost as unreal as the lyrics are 👌
"Excellent feedback from early Tesla V3 owners. Almost 2,000 miles on a single charge."

"Yes, you can own Minecraft!"
"That btw is Tesla. I said earlier that I was for shutting down AI, but added support for both full self-driving and road-legal sensors."
"Our Semi Falcon 9 flight successful. Waterproofing, telemetry &amp; mouse pad secured. Will spend 3 hours getting static electricity &amp; applying a cathode raym on the rocket’s final segment."
"Why are you so dogematic, they ask. I tell them “they” will love it”"

Lame. Look at those legs. Feels like flamethrowers.
"Last known state for rocket boost stage is 360 m/s, Mach 1.1, 8.5 kN, RCS power 902, 500 km/h coverage, top speed of 354 km/h. Our 3 stage Cybertruck will enable multi rocket to reach the Space Station in one go."
"And also my sympathies to the great people of Russia, who do not want this to happen. Do not give in to blackmail by any means necessary!"
"Price increase for Tesla FSD postponed until version 10 with smart summon is in wide release, which is about 4 to 8 months away, depending on how early access goes"
"Mechazilla will do this for future rockets, but it’s too difficult a situation with no competitors. Sigular will do this only for Mechazilla."

"Both reasons are spelled out clearly in the Act: (1) we don't want coal; (2) climate is real is deeply held faith; (3) we are sued around the world for doing so, as we've done in the past; (4) we are environmentally toxic is sheer coincidence;(5) atherosclerosis is a government conspiracy; bulimia is a private citizen good family)."

"Welcome @TeslaMotors International global leader, Lee Jae-won. Mr Chairman &amp; CEO of Tesla, I thank @Motors for #RIP"
Our Model S hit the track in less than 2 seconds. It was able to coast for a few miles before diving back to the launchpad. All good on the rocket.
"The Tesla Truck has become the most advanced, fully autonomous electric truck ever made. No self-driving car has ever flown in a vacuum. It's unreal."

There is a lot of accounting trickery in this bill. We will need to cover much of Tesla's legal bill.
The price of a Tesla FSD is $550. It can go from near your car to 5 or more owners within ~1.5 miles. You pay $550 extra for a normal car vs $550 for a Full Self-Driving option.

And then we are done …
"Cause of hard landing data: Autopilot indicating hard landing attempted, but failed to reach intended destination, but satellite tracking indicated otherwise. Also, this was not an intentional flight. Postponing launch to earlier today, assuming wind is better then."
It’s choc chip-free
Aiming for moderate to high velocity this weekend from @SpaceX Falcon 9 booster and reentry (~1000 km altitude) @NASA. Distant moons: Uranus &amp; Neptune.

Of particular concern is the rapidly deteriorating condition of the Primary CyberGrid via Cyberlink Interface.
"If speed at stage separation &amp; amperage is low, descent will be less than 4% and max return ~12km ( 10 / to surface). This is mainly true for deep water, which has slightly more viscosity &amp; has less friction. This is also true for snow, which has slightly more viscosity, hence less friction. Also, layers of snow, like a bouncy castle, are inherently bouncy."
Great news that they are ok. Rocket is healthy. No injuries or deaths noted.
"Regulatory approvals received, so Model 3 will go to mass production in ~2 years."
"The Boring Company was built on a castle, of course. The Model S builds on the premise that we will."
The actual software (SDK) release is s t w code generator
"Motor Trend reviewed the new Tesla software v8.0 with some initial pass Oxygen effect &amp; confirmed it was working well. Added more gas in 2-3 weeks, speed up to 4.0 (with air release)"
Payload will be my midnight cherry Tesla Roadster in North America on April 15. Only $70 less than Full Self-Driving ($250 for an Autopilot subscription).
"Much of what we do is to make life multiplanetary, with EVA, where you literally fly like a rocket to orbit"

Supercharger announcement pushed to next week. Will be at SXSW in force until May 29.
"And as if on behalf of the Earth community, we petition to have Tesla &amp; SolarCity named after US (and worldwide) cities"
Which means millions of dollars in debt if we don't make Tesla &amp; Teslaray soon. What with all the digital products &amp; the Model S.

Navigation has pros and cons. Cons:
- Quick start
- Less comfortable navigating around the car. Cons:
- Doesn't support all flight sim flight.
"- Requires Internet, so best flight simulation is not out the window."
"- Requires Autopilot software to function. (version 10 or newer) Model 3 software downloaded about 8 hours after flight. Wings flaps open, lights go green. Hoping software tugs it can outside crash testing."

"On Twitter, likes are surprisingly high. So high, in fact, that it almost feels like a spaceship is sucking at their spaceshipburg."
"Tesla is actually subsidizing almost all electric cars made in the U.S. That being said, we believe that a small tax on EVs actually benefits consumers better than nothing. So-called 'incentives' simply don't work, like applying a tax to buy a new car. They just make more sense to most people."
"And, of course, it will have no eggs on toast"
The first FSD variant is already in production. It will have dual motor and all-wheel drive w crazy power! Enhanced design improves reliability and looks good.

Next significant product milestone is a Hyperloop pod being tested right now. Wings flaps &amp; control pod w/o pucker factorizing.
